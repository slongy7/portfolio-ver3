## Updated Portfolio

Link:  https://slongy7.github.io/UpdatedPortfolio/

## Goal
This project is to update my portfolio which was assigned earlier in the class.  This is to add our second group project, and to update our portfolio with some of the technologies and ideas that we have learned since then.  We are also supposed to highlight some of our other applications that we are proud of completing.

I also updated my resume, Github and LinkedIn account.
